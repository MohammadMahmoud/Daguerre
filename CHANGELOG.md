## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Capture the visible area, the entire page (scrolls, stitches, and hides repeated sticky headers), a selected area, or every tab in the window.
- Area selection that scrolls the page when you drag to the edge, so selections can be taller than the screen.
- Capture progress dialog with Cancel; keyboard shortcuts, right-click menu and a 3, 5 or 10 second delay.
- Editor with crop handles, arrows, shapes, pen, highlighter, text, numbered steps and pixelate. Edits stay re-editable and support undo and redo.
- Export to lossless PNG, compressed JPEG or WebP with live size estimates, multi-page PDF, searchable PDF, clipboard and print.
- On-device text recognition (English): Copy Text and searchable PDFs.
- Local-only history with search, filters, bulk delete and undo.

### Security
